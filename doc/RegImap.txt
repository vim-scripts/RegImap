USAGE                                                         *RegImap-usage*

RegImap plugin allows you to type text more efficiently by defining your
mappings, that will be used, while you typing text. For example, in vim you
often type nnoremap. To speed up this job, you can define the following
mapping:
>
 call RegImap('^nno', 'nnoremap ', {'filetype' : 'vim'})
<

First argument is a {pattern}, that defines when the substitute will done.
Second argument is a {substitute} pattern, that will be inserted instead of
the {pattern}. Third argument defines filetype, when this substitute will
work. Now you need to type only three characters at the start of the line to
get full word and a space. Note that this substitute will not performed in any
other place of the text.

But, for example, you have to type also inoremap, vnoremap and others. Of
course, you can call separate |RegImap| function for each word, but there is
more efficient way:
>
 call RegImap('^\([nisxvolc]\)no', '\1noremap ', {'filetype' : 'vim'})
<

Now, regular expression is used for the first argument. Only one character out
of "nisxvolc" will match, and it is passed to the second argument.

More formally, |RegImap| works like executing s/{pattern}/{substitute}/ every
time you enter a character or move the cursor in insert mode.

In your {substitute} pattern you can use |PlaceHolders|. They are defined be |PH|. 
You can jump to the next placeholder by pressing <tab> button, or cicle
through available |PlaceHolders| by <S-Tab>. Look at |RegImap-options| fom
more detailes.

New patterns are defined by |RegImap| function. You can use it directly at you
vim file at ftplugin directory. More convinent way is to keep them all at the
RegImap folder with names ft.vim for filetype ft. They are automatically
sourced, when you enter a buffer.

If, when you typed a key in insert mode multiple {pattern}'s match, the one
that was defined first will be used.

Look at |RegImap-patterns| for more examples.

COMMANDS                                                   *RegImap-commands*

                                                                    *RegImap*
RegImap({pattern}, {substitute}, [, {parameters}])

RegImap adds a new regular mapping. Essentially RegImap defines a |CursorMovedI|
autocommand that performs substitute 's/{pattern}/{substitute}/' in the insert
mode at the cursor position. {pattern} and {substitute} are regular
expressions. You can use there |RegImap-variables| and |PlaceHolder|. Simple
example:
>
 call RegImap('^\s\+r ', 'return ')
<

Every time you typing 'r' and <space> at the start of the line you will
automatically get 'return '.

You can also use vim script in {substitute} field, see |sub-replace-expression|.
For example:
>
 call RegImap('\<cdate', '\=strftime("%Y-%m-%d")')
<

{parameters} are additional options in the form
>
 {'option1' : value1, 'option2' : value2, ... }
<

Possible options are:
  - {filetype}, default 'common'. Mapping will work only in specified
    filetype. 'common' means that this pattern will work in all files.
  - {condition}, default ''. Additional pattern that is checked before 
    {pattern}. If it is not sutisfied, substitute is not performed. Added for
    efficiency, when using complex or multiline {pattern}.
  - {feedkeys}, default ''. Keys, that are send to vim after successfull
    substitute. Default values of these parameters can be changed by
    |RegImap-SetParameters|.

Note If {pattern} does not contain atom '\%#' (matches at cursor position),
     then it is added to the end. If {substitute} does not contain
     |PlaceHolder| calls, one |PlaceHolder| is added to the end.

After substitute 's/{pattern}/{substitute}/' is done, cursor is moved to the
next |PlaceHolder|.

After that |feedkeys| is called fith {feedkeys} argument.


SetParameters([{parameters}])                         *RegImap-SetParameters*

With this function you can change default values of {parameters}, specified in
|RegImap|. If you call it without arguments, {parameters} are reset to
defaults.


PH([{string}])                           *PlaceHolder*   *RegImap-PlaceHolders*

Return a Placeholder with possible default value after placeholder selection.
Basicall for {substitute} fields.


ReadRegImaps()                                         *RegImap-ReadRegImaps*

Sourses .vim files from directories, specified by |RegImap-basedir|. This files
usually contain vim scripts, |RegImap| calls.


==============================================================================
VARIABLES                                                 *RegImap-variables*

Usefull variables to use in {pattern} fields.

OPTIONS                                                     *RegImap-options*

You can change values of this variables in your .vimrc file.

                                                            *RegImap-basedir*  >
  let g:baseDir = &runtimepath
<

Mappings are by default looked for any RegImap directory in your
'runtimepath'. Typically, it is located at '~/.vim/RegImap/' on *nix or
'$HOME\vimfiles\RegImap\' on Windows. To change that location or add another
one, change the g:baseDir variable in your |.vimrc| to your preferred
directory. This will be used by the |globpath()| function, and so accepts the
same syntax as it (e.g., comma-separated paths).

                                                          *RegImap-useNextPH*  >
  let useNextPH = '<Tab>'
<

If *popupmenu-completion* is visible (it is patterned by <C-X>, omni
complition or other), then <C-E> key is send, leading to selection of
current item. Else cursor is moved to the next |PlaceHolder|. It works in
insert, normal or select modes. |PlaceHolder| is removed and if it has default
value it is inserted.

                                                       *RegImap-selectNextPH*  >
  let selectNextPH = '<S-Tab>'
<

Move cursor to the next |PlaceHolder|, without expanding them. They are just
selected, allowing you to delete it by pressing any key or using
|RegImap-clearSelection| key. You also can expand it by pressing <Tab>. If
there is no |PlaceHolder| in file, nothing happens.

                                                     *RegImap-exitSelectMode*  >
  let exitSelectMode = ';'
<

Key to exit from select mode to normal mode. Selected text is left unchanged.

                                                  *RegImap-clearSelectedText*  >
  let clearSelectedText = '<C-j>'
<

Key to clear selected text and go to insert mode. If it results in empty
string, it is deleted.


==============================================================================
PATTERNS FOR SPECIFIC FILETYPES                            *RegImap-patterns*

Here are described several mapping for different filetypes. You can find more
in your |RegImap-baseDir| directory. All of them are for insert mode, cursor
position is indicated by | character.


VIM                                                             *RegImap-vim*

If you are not inside string by typing semicolon you will exit insert mode.
This is much more usefull than <Esc> of <C-[>.

FEATURES                                                   *RegImap-features*

RegImap plugin has the following features among others:
  - The syntax of |RegImap| allows to use TextMate's or other snippets. But
    maybe you will want to improve them with the power of regular expressions.
  - Dinamic update of linked variables is possible by defining appropriate
    mapping. See |for| loop for CPP and |begin-end| for TEX
  - PlaceHolders within placeholders are possible, look at 'case ' pattern for
    cpp.
